The project pnclude Login logic that validate, authenticate and authorize User and Admin accordingly (This means access restriction is included in the project).

The project properly display necessary error messages.

The project include a SignUP logic and every necessary validation  and authentication.

The project include a Logout logic.

The project include "Create book" link which only ADMIN can access.

The Project include a homepage where user can request for books.

The project respond to user book request accordingly.



WHAT I DIDNT DO

I didnt have enough time to look through how to implement MongoDB with Spring so I used MySql which I am used to.

No much design.
